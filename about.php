            <p class="text-justify textBackground">Camping is one of Americaâ€™s favorite pastimes. There are 58 national parks in the US, with 9 alone in California and over 13,000 campgrounds in the US. But there is no website for camping enthusiasts to share their camping experiences with others.</p>
            <p class="text-justify textBackground">Many times I have went to a new national park not know what to expect and how to prepare, leaving me wishing I had brought certain items to make the experience more pleasurable. My website is aimed at both beginning and expert campers as a platform to share photos, reviews of campgrounds, tips, tricks and other helpful information. This will help with preparing for trips along with a social twist where you can post photos of your trip. </p>
